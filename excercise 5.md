## Excercise 5:The cannon
### Problem
- Caculate the trajectory of our cannon shell including both air drag and the reduced air density at high altitude so that you can reproduce the results in Figure 2.5.Preform your calculation for different firing angles and determine the value of the angle that give the maximum range.
